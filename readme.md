# Cold Mail Generator with Streamlit, LangChain, and ChromaDB

## Overview

This project is a Streamlit-based application that generates cold emails for business development, using job descriptions from career pages and portfolio links to tailor emails for potential clients. The app utilizes the following technologies:

- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
- **LangChain**: For handling prompt templates and interacting with an LLM (Large Language Model).
- **ChromaDB**: For managing and querying a vector database of portfolio links.
- **Pandas**: For loading and processing the portfolio data from a CSV file.

## Features

- Scrapes job descriptions from a given career page URL.
- Extracts key information (job role, skills, experience, description) from the scraped text.
- Generates a tailored cold email using predefined templates.
- Queries a vector database (ChromaDB) to find relevant portfolio links based on extracted skills.
- Displays the generated email using Streamlit.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- The following Python packages:
  - `pandas`
  - `streamlit`
  - `chromadb`
  - `langchain`
  - `dotenv`

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cold-mail-generator.git
   cd cold-mail-generator
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content:
     ```bash
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
     ```

4. Add your portfolio data:
   - Place your portfolio CSV file at `resource/my_portfolio.csv`.
   - The CSV should have the following columns:
     - `Techstack`: Technologies or skills used.
     - `Links`: URLs or links to showcase your work.

## Project Structure

├── chain.py           # Manages LLM prompt chains for job extraction and email writing.
├── main.py            # Entry point, builds the Streamlit app.

```

## Usage

To start the Streamlit app, run:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

### Workflow

1. **Input URL**: Enter a job posting URL in the input field.
2. **Submit**: Click the 'Submit' button to scrape the job description.
3. **Extract Jobs**: The app extracts key job details from the scraped text.
4. **Generate Email**: Using the extracted job details and relevant portfolio links, the app generates a tailored cold email for business development.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: `TypeError: cannot pickle 'classmethod' object`
If you encounter this error, it is likely due to how `PersistentClient` in ChromaDB or objects in LangChain are being used. This issue arises when trying to use non-pickleable objects (e.g., class methods) in a multi-threaded environment like Streamlit.

**Possible Fixes**:
- Review your `PersistentClient` usage and ensure it’s not holding non-pickleable objects.
- Consider initializing the client outside of the Streamlit app functions or limiting how it's used in threaded environments.

## Future Improvements

- **Error Handling**: Better handling for edge cases like invalid URLs or empty job descriptions.
- **Email Customization**: Allow users to customize email templates and portfolio links dynamically.
- **Parallelism**: Investigate the use of parallel processing for scraping multiple pages efficiently.
